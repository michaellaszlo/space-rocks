# Space Rocks

## Components of a browser game based on Asteroids

This is a game about a spaceship that has to evade large rocks in
space. Yes, it's a clone of Asteroids. No, it isn't finished.


## Current features

* A randomly generated star field decorates the background.

* Space rocks are spawned with random motion vectors and random spin.

* You control the spaceship with the W-A-D keys: W to activate the
thruster, A to rotate counterclockwise, and D to rotate clockwise.

* Friction gradually slows the spaceship. The space rocks are unaffected
by friction.

## To be done next

* Add collision detection.

* Let the spaceship shoot missiles.

* When a rock is struck by a missile, split it into smaller rocks.
